### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I like to develop professional web-sites using HTML5 and CSS3.  
- Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, eager to bring interactivity into my own portfolio and psychological projects.  
- Iâ€™m currently working on a web-site about Andragogy because this topic is one of my key professional interests.  
- Fun fact about me is that it would be eventually my 3rd professional background after Management and Psychology and I feel like coming back to my roots as my first job was all about Computers, IT and Web-development where I functioned as a Marketing specialist and a team-leader... 
- I was always keen on launching creative products and services meeting estethics and usability criteria.
- Hopefully my contribution here would be fruitful...

BR,
